# I am trying our `ReactJS`.

Today I learned about [`CATaaS`](https://cataas.com/#/), and I wanted to try and publish a simple paginated app with GitHub Pages. So building something this terrifying was inevitable.

Employers current and future, do not hold this against me. I had 30 minutes of boredom and spent 15 of them making this. (The other 15min were spent admiring the `CATaaS` API's)
